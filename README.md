# Sudoku
To play the game, open the Product folder using your favourite IDE and run WelcomeWindow.java .
I created a Sudoku game for desktop with emphasis on OOP, some recursion and using existing Java libraries.
The idea was to run a top-to-bottom simulation of building a product for a client. 
You can view the documentation folder for the different stages of the project.
